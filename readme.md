C and C++ are related languages with some fundamental differences:

1. **Paradigm:**
   - **C** is a procedural programming language. It focuses on procedures or functions to execute tasks.
   - **C++** is a multi-paradigm language. It encompasses procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms.

2. **OOP Support:**
   - **C** doesn't have built-in support for object-oriented programming. It lacks concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
   - **C++** supports object-oriented programming with classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.

3. **Header Files:**
   - **C** uses header files (`*.h`) for declarations and function prototypes.
   - **C++** uses both header and source files (`*.h` for declarations and `*.cpp` for definitions), although it's not strictly necessary for defining classes or functions.

4. **Function and Variable Declarations:**
   - In **C**, all variable declarations must precede executable code within a block, typically at the beginning.
   - In **C++**, variable declarations can be interspersed with executable code.

5. **Memory Management:**
   - **C** relies on functions like `malloc()` and `free()` for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
   - **C++** introduces the `new` and `delete` operators for memory allocation and deallocation along with additional constructs like smart pointers (`std::shared_ptr`, `std::unique_ptr`) to manage memory more safely.

6. **Standard Libraries:**
   - Both **C** and **C++** have their own standard libraries, but **C++** extends and enhances the functionalities of the C standard library. It includes additional features like the Standard Template Library (STL) for containers (like vectors, lists, maps) and algorithms.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - **C** traditionally uses error codes and `errno` for error handling.
   - **C++** introduces exceptions handling with `try`, `catch`, and `throw` for more structured error handling.

8. **Compatibility:**
   - **C++** is largely compatible with C. You can often compile C code within a C++ compiler, although there might be a need for some adjustments due to the additional features in C++.

9. **Namespace Support:**
   - **C** lacks namespace support.
   - **C++** introduces namespaces to avoid naming collisions and provide better modularity.

Both languages have their strengths and are used in various domains. C is commonly used in system programming, embedded systems, and low-level programming due to its efficiency and simplicity. C++, with its additional features, is popular in application software, game development, system software, and more complex projects where object-oriented features are beneficial.
