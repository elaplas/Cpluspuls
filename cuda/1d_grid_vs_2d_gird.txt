You are tasked with processing a grayscale image of size 1024 x 1024 pixels using CUDA.
Each pixel is represented as a float, and the operation you need to perform is an
element-wise transformation of the image where each pixel's value is squared.

Part 1: 1D Kernel Implementation
Implement a CUDA kernel that treats the image as a 1D array (of size 1024 x 1024 =
1048576 elements) and processes each pixel in parallel. Write the kernel and the
corresponding kernel launch configuration.

Part 2: 2D Kernel Implementation
Now, rewrite the kernel to process the image using a 2D grid and block configuration, with each
thread handling a specific (x, y) pixel. Write the 2D kernel and the corresponding kernel
launch configuration.


Part 3: Performance Consideration
Compare the two approaches in terms of:
● Hardware optimizations
● Scalability to larger images (e.g., 3848 x 2160)
Which approach would you recommend for efficient image processing on larger datasets, and
why?



For optimal memory throughput, a warp (32 threads) should ideally access a contiguous region of memory. 
Each CUDA block contains multiple warps. 

In 1D access patterns—using a 1D grid of blocks—threads within each warp access consecutive elements in an array.
This alignment increases memory locality, reducing cache misses and optimizing memory access. In contrast, 2D access patterns-using 
a 2D grid of blocks—only achieve contiguous access within rows of a block. If the width of the 2D block is a multiple of 32, it ensures
contiguous access within each warp, maximizing memory throughput.

When working with 2D data structures, such as grayscale images, 2D access patterns map more naturally to the data, 
allowing for straightforward indexing of elements based on thread and block coordinates. This is particularly helpful 
when the data dimensions do not align precisely with block dimensions, enabling each block to independently process 
patches of the image. This independence allows for the efficient handling of large images by dividing them into smaller,
manageable 2D patches (2D blocks), which is more challenging in 1D access patterns, where data is primarily accessed column-wise. 
This column-wise access makes 2D operations, such as convolutions, more complex to implement for very large images.  


Numpy to CUDA translation question:
Part 1: CUDA Implementation
Translate the following Python NumPy code into a C++ program that uses CUDA. Your solution
should:
1. Implement matrix multiplication using a CUDA kernel.
2. Implement an element-wise sigmoid transformation using another CUDA kernel.

The Python code is as follows:
import numpy as np
def sigmoid(x):
return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))
def matrix_operations(A, B):
# Perform matrix multiplication
C = np.dot(A, B)
# Apply element-wise transformation: sigmoid function
C_transformed = sigmoid(C)
return C_transformed
A = [[4, 2], [7, 5]]
B = [[8, 6], [9, 1]]
