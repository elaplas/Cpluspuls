/**
 * what would happen without RVO (return value optimization):
 * 
 * Constructor is called for obj
 * copy constuctor is called to return a copy of obj
 * destructor is called to destroy obj
 * destructor is called to destroy the copy of obj
 * copy constructor Ã­s called to construct result
 * destructor is called to destroy result
 * 
 * what happens with RVO:
 * 
 * complier allocates memory for result in caller scope (in this case in function main())
 * and in-place creates the result
